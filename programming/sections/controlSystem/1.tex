\part{Hardware and Control System}
In this section, we will give an overview of the hardware behind the programming aspect of FTC. Note that the information here is specific to using REV stuff; Modern Robotics is something that while (maybe) still legal, you should avoid using.

Rough explanations of the various sensors, motors, etc will be provided. However, detailed information on usage and the like are in a separate section.

The REV Expansion Hub is the core of the current control system. This is the piece of hardware which controls the various pieces of hardware on the bot.

\section{Motors}
If you're building a robot, you can't escape motors. Most likely you will be using the Andymark NeverRest motors for the competition as they are the most effective. There are 3 main motors in this series: 60s,  40s and 20s.
